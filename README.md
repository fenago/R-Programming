# R Programming Fundamentals
This course introduces tools for working with data, focused on R and the R ecosystem. It begins by showing you how to set up R and RStudio. The course explains R packages, functions, data structures, control flow, and loops. Once you are comfortable with the basics, it explains data visualization and graphics. You learn how to build statistical and advanced plots using the powerful ggplot2 library. You learn data management concepts, such as factors, pivots, aggregation, merging, and dealing with missing values. By the end of this course, you are ready to complete an entire data science project of your own for your portfolio or blog.
